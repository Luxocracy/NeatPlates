---------------------------
6.18.11
---------------------------
* I got injured a few weeks ago, halting my progress, so I may have broken some things, and then forgot to fix them...

* Core: Different hiding method for Blizzard nameplates.  Might be a unreliable?  Changed to fix tainting issues.
* Core: Updated the TOC versions.

* Threat Line: The widget will auto update with no fading.
* Core: Increased the Target & Mouseover FrameLevels
* Hub: Filter: "Filter Players" will now filter players full-time.
* Core: unit.reaction will default to "HOSTILE" if it can't be determined  (Should mitigate color.lua reaction color error)

* Off-Tank Aggro: Party/Raid Threat  IsTank()  (unitid.."target") somethingerother?


---------------------------
6.18.10
---------------------------
* Core: RAID_TARGET_UPDATE, Full update
* Core: Reverted unit.reaction gather function to using UnitSelectionColor.
* Aura Widget: Removed the wonky Hide call.

---------------------------
6.18.9
---------------------------
* Utility: Replaced GetAggroCondition()
* Core: Added RAID_TARGET_UPDATE event to core
* Aura Widget: Added some missing ClearAllPoints()
* Core: Updated unit.reaction function.  Now uses UnitReaction().  What a concept!
* Threat Line Widget: Fixed anchor point..  the widget itself needs some work, though.

---------------------------
6.18.7
---------------------------
* Utility: Replaced GetAggroCondition()

---------------------------
6.18.7
---------------------------
* Core: Restored the WidgetReset function; Not quite ready to take that plunge.
* Aura Widget: Some fixes and tweaks
* Cure: Added, TidyPlates:GetThemeName()


---------------------------
6.18.4
---------------------------
* Major Internal Changes Warning!

* Core/Utility: Totally and utterly removed all the caching that we used to do to store Guild names, Titles, Classes, etc.
	IsGuildMate and IsFriend have been bypassed, so those functions don't do anything. Consquently,
	the associated features are temporarily disabled.

* Core: The Widget Reset function has been removed, which will possibly cause some problems with Non-Hub themes, but will help
	to fix some memory leakage.  I want to avoid repetitively destroying/creating frames, so now the Hub functions will attempt
	to call widget:UpdateConfig() and recycle/reconfig the old frames instead of nil-ing the old ones and creating new ones.

* Combo Points: Now displays a 6th when you're using Deeper Strategem.  Anticipation will still use the 5+Overlap method to display.
* Combo Points: Chi does not show up on Brewmaster Monks

* Hub: Tapped Color on Healthbars is now working again
* Themes: Fixed some elite/level display problems
* Hub: Active/Damaged Units: On NPCs, if the unit has a target, it's considered active.

* Hub: Guildmate and Friend colors are temporarily disabled.


---------------------------
6.18.3
---------------------------
* Mini Mob Headline is now Off by Default
* Neutral Unit Headline is now Off by Default
* Neon Level Text field width increased (to fix 100+ not being displayed correctly)
* Fixed TotemIcon nil field error
* Fixed Approximate Health
* Fixed text shadow flag
* Fixed friendly auras appearing when using "Show Dispellable.."
* And more little fixes

---------------------------
6.18.2 - Happy Legion Day!
---------------------------
* Typo in Quest display

---------------------------
6.18.1 - Happy Legion Day!
---------------------------
* RESTORED the "Use Blizzard Font" from the Hub/Profile panel.  This will use the STANDARD_TEXT_FONT
* Note: "Force Blizzard Font" has been renamed to "Force Multi-lingual Font" to make its purpose clear.
* Renamed/Repurposed "Filter NPC" to "Filter Enemy NPC"
* Added: "Filter Non-Titled Friendly NPC".. Which hides friendly NPCs that DON'T have a title, such as "Innkeeper".
* Added: Experimental: Quest display on Headline Status Text.

---------------------------
6.18.Beta21
---------------------------

* "Force Blizzard Font" added to the Tidy Plates main panel.  This will use the Fritz Quadrata family,
	and possibly fix localization issues
* REMOVED the "Use Default Blizzard Font" from the Hub.  See above.

# Fixed "Spotlight on Casting" Opacity
* Fixed "Bar Width" shrinking

* Better nil handling
* Layering improvements
* In Hub\Templates, changed OnEvent handler to OnShow and removed panel:RegisterEvent("PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD")
	(This will keep it from being called until the panel is shown)

* Broke Guildmate and Friend coloring.  I'll fix at some point.
* On the good side, No more caching of NPC roles!  They can be read instantly, now.

* Cleaned up some ancient cludgy code.

* Introduced more bugs. (It always happens!)


---------------------------
6.18.Beta20
---------------------------
Aura Widget typo fix
Hopefully final fix for Blizzard Bars appearing
Temporarily restored the outdated UseTankVariables and UseDamageVariables functions
Tinkered with the ShadowOffset

---------------------------
6.18.Beta19
---------------------------
Isolated the theme parser to TidyPlatesParser.lua

Loading themes via functions:
	TidyPlates:SetTheme(themeNameString)
	TidyPlates:GetTheme()

Deprecated:		(Converted to Dummy functions, will be removed)
	TidyPlates:ActivateTheme(themeNameString)
	TidyPlates:ReloadTheme()

Moved "Use Default Blizzard Font" down to the bottom of the Settings page
	Didn't seem to be in the right place under "Health Bars"
Advanced is now "Funky Stuff".  Why?  Because I've been drinking?  Perhaps..
Hub: Fixed Unit Filter Alpha
Rejiggered some things in the Panels
	Hub/Profile Panels are now under the Tidy Plates tree
Renamed some of the Core files
Cleaned up some old rotten code in Core and Panel


---------------------------
6.18.Beta18
---------------------------
Panel fix

---------------------------
6.18.Beta17
---------------------------
Off-Tank Highlighting is back!  (/hub, jump to "Threat")

Specialization Profiles are Back!

And with them, new errors to find.

Also, it's painful to look at code that I haven't touched in 5 years



---------------------------
6.18.Beta15
---------------------------
Cooldown fixes, perhaps?

---------------------------
6.18.Beta13
---------------------------
Aura Widget..  made it so OmniCC and the like won't mess with cooldown animations.


---------------------------
6.18.Beta11
---------------------------
More futzing with the Aura widget.  Stacks should show up.  Dispellable stuff might show up.


---------------------------
6.18.Beta10
---------------------------
Combo Point Widget should now update properly.


---------------------------
6.18.Beta9
---------------------------
Aura Widget is now about 90% complete

Fixed some errors when Personal Resource Frame is used (alpha.lua:30)


---------------------------
6.18.Beta8
---------------------------
Aura Widget is now about 80% complete

Under the Tidy Plates options panel, you can now disable cast bars


---------------------------
6.18.Beta7
---------------------------
Personal resource bar should work on it's own.

Class widget repair

Cast bar alpha
Tradeskill bypass on castbar

Tank autoswap may work correctly on your class;  Works fine for druids!


---------------------------
6.18.Beta6
---------------------------
Level coloring + text should be improved.

FULLY hiding the Blizzard frames.. success!  Thanks N!

CVar stuff

Some health status text should now be working


---------------------------
6.18.Beta5
---------------------------
Raid Icons should be working

Flickering is still a bit of a problem.

Frame rates are lower than desired.

I need to work on the widgets (auras, healer tracking, tank tracking, etc.)


---------------------------
6.18.Beta4
---------------------------
Class colors working better?
The new Cast Bars have been written.  Hopefully they work.  I've only been testing near the target dummies.


---------------------------
6.18.Beta3
---------------------------
Class Colors should be working.  On health bars, at least.  I briefly tested them.
Nameplates are not (and can not be) generated for enemies who are not in pvp conditions.  (This has been the case for years)

Cast bars..  Early next week, I hope.

Calm down, take a deep breath.  It's Friday, July 22nd!  It's time for beverages!


---------------------------
6.18.Beta2
---------------------------
More things are working!

Notably absent...
Cast Bars
and more

I have not tested the aura widget... although it MIGHT work.



---------------------------
6.18.Beta1
---------------------------
Nameplate-pocalypse!!!!!!!

99% of the previous nameplate system has been replaced by Blizzard for Legion.

Rebuilding has been slow, since I'm (apparently) a grown-up, now. ;-)

BUT, progress is indeed being made!

The internal widgets are disabled, which means the Aura timers are not working.  I'm rewriting the entire bloody system because we now have a good way to capture that data without all the trickery that was previously required.  (Blizzard does love us!)

Again, progress is being made!

Many things are broken, so I expect that many of you might want to check back with Tidy Plates in a week or so.

Happy questing!


---------------------------
6.17.1
---------------------------
- Core: New value: unit.healthmaxCached, which is updated on target and mouseover.
	(This uses the UnitHealthMax API function to store real health data.)
- Core: Where available, uses the healthmaxCached to create real numbers.
- Core: Figured out what the other statusbar is.. incoming heals.  But you guys already knew that.  Hiding that stuff, for now.
- Hub: If healthmaxCached doesn't exist, the real health value won't be shown.  (Percent will still work)

---------------------------
6.17.0
---------------------------
- Partially updated the core to the new internal Blizzard nameplate layout.  Seems to fix a bunch of things for me.  ymmv
- Not sure what some of the new bits and pieces are for... futher investigation is needed.

---------------------------
6.16.1
---------------------------
- Threat System: Disabled 'Other Tank' functions, for now; They're broken, and causing secondary issues to develop.

---------------------------
6.16.Beta: Quick Notes
---------------------------
This is a MAJOR update to Tidy Plates, and many things have changed.

Here are some of the bigger changes:

* The Hub has been revamped and some rearranging has been done.
* Quick Fix - Quick Setup:
	1. Use '/tp' to reselect your Theme (and Profile)
	2. Use '/hub' to check your settings...

* Some settings have been pruned; If there was something important that got
	removed, let me know...

* Numerous Bug Fixes & Improvements
* Numerous Bug "Additions"? (Quite possible!)

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience these changes may cause...

Think of this: Changes mean that this addon is being actively developed and
	maintained, rather than withering, as many addons do...



--------------------------------------
6.16.Beta8
--------------------------------------
* Hub: Threat: Highlight Mobs Tanked by Other Tanks:  It was a mess. Rewrote and tested with hunter pet, and it's working well in that condition.
	- To do:  Reimplement Combat Log melee swing detection, and test in 5-man and Raids

--------------------------------------
6.16.Beta7
--------------------------------------
* I haven't been keeping track of changes.  Warlords- yay!

Things still needing testing...
* Healer Tracking
* Tank Target-Of-Mob Tracking

--------------------------------------
6.16.Beta6
--------------------------------------
* Some fixes, some additions..

Things still needing testing...

--------------------------------------
6.16.Beta5
--------------------------------------
* Lots of things that I didn't write down because I'm busy playing Warlords of Freakin' Draenor woot!
* Fixed some bugs
* Added some new bugs, probably
* Lots of changes to the Hub.  Feedback is good.  Be polite, please!

6.16.Beta4:
--------------------------------------
* Themes: Migrated Quatre, Grey, and Graphite to the new system
* Hub/Themes: New function definition process, makes it easier to add themes
* Numerous bug fixes..  Can't remember.  Been leveling my druid.  Sleep; Need more of.

--------------------------------------
6.16.Beta3:
--------------------------------------
* Hub/Aura Widget: Fixed an issue which would prevent your auras from showing up (Previous configuration conflict)

--------------------------------------
6.16.Beta3:
--------------------------------------
* Widget/Combo Points: Fixed?

--------------------------------------
6.16.Beta2:
--------------------------------------
* Widgets/UnitCache: Fix for mouseover bug
* Class Coloring: Fixed IsInInstance() issue.. maybe?
* Hub:  Removed "Default" choice from the Friendly and Enemy Coloring Modes  (Yeah, this will make current settings funk-up...  but it cleans out that redundant choice)

--------------------------------------
6.16.Beta1: Full-ish List of Changes:
--------------------------------------

Core:
* Core/Panel: !! The Bundled themes no longer create a "Damage" and "Tank" copy !!
* Core/Panel: Introduced a new menu set, called Profiles, which will load the appropriate "Damage", "Tank", or "Healer" Hub profile.
* Core/Panel: When the selected theme is invalid, it'll fall-back to the first available theme.
* Core/Panel: Added a Slash Command alias, "/tp" in addition to "/tidyplates"

Bundled Themes:
* Themes: Neon & Quatre now have CastProtected art.  About time!
* Neon: New Elite Icon, which looks more like I'd originally intended.  (Replaces the old Star)
* Removed "Blizzard Theme"...  Sorry guys...  There are core things that I want to get done, and fixing/maintaining
	that component is not a priority.  It will probably return, but don't hold your breath.

Widgets:
* Widgets/UnitCache: Replaced " (*)" with FOREIGN_SERVER_LABEL, which will fix unit-caching on certain server types.
* Widgets/UnitCache: Now using a Scanning Tooltip, which should prevent conflicts with TipTac and other Tooltip mods
* Widgets/Aura: Combat Log Event Handler now skips units which are group members, relying on the general
	Unit event handler for their updates.

Hub/General:
* Hub: Colorized 'Friendly' and 'Enemy' description titles, to improve readability.
* Separated Hub functions.lua into discrete category files
* Tweaked some names/descriptions
* Removed Threat Wheel widget from Hub
* Hub: Added a button to the Advanced category; "Clear Cache", which purges the stored Class/Description/Guild data
* Hub/Advanced: "Health Bar Width" (%) Allows you to tweak the relative width of the theme's Health Bar  (Experimental)

Hub/Colors:
* Hub/Reaction: New Color, "Tapped Unit"
* Hub/Color Function: Tapped Color will be applied, taking priority over Threat/Etc. functions

Hub/Scale:
* Hub: Scale: Added, Bring Target units to Spotlight Scale, Bring Mouseovers to Spotlight Scale

Hub/Health Bar View:
* Removed several of the Status Text choices; These will reappear in a more advanced "Custom Text" category  (Working on it...)
* NOTE: The CUSTOM/ADVANCED Status Text function hasn't been written, yet; Thus, it doesn't do anything at the moment...

Hub/Opacity:
* Hub: Opacity: Enemy & Friendly units now have their own independent Spotlight Modes
* Hub: Opacity: Spotlight Modes; Removal of some redundant and underused modes.
* Hub: Opacity: New Checkbox, "Spotlight Raid Marked"
* Hub: Opacity: Modified Checkbox, "Bring Mouseovers to Target Opacity" to "Spotlight Mouseover"
* Hub: Opacity: Modified Checkbox, "Bring Casting Units to Target Opacity" to "Spotlight Casting Units"

Hub/Aura Widget:
* Hub: Buffs & Debuffs: Replaced "Aura Widget Mode" Dropdown with Checkboxes: "Include My Buffs", and "Include My Debuffs".
* Hub: Buffs & Debuffs: The widget will now use a Smart Mode, where it first evaluates the checkboxes, then evaluates the Aura List.
* Hub: Buffs & Debuffs: Added the "Not" prefix to the aura list; This new mode allows you to blacklist auras from "Show My Debuffs" etc.

Framework:
* Hub: Quick Frame Templates now return the created frame twice (ie. assign two references with a single call, which helps with the Quick Frame setup)
* Fixed some Odd Mouseover Behavior
* Rearranged and removed some old Hub stuff.  Cleaning out functions, removing ancient code, removed items of questionable utility



---------------------------
6.15.3
---------------------------
* Combo Widget: Fixed monk and localization issues
* Blizzard theme; "Fixed" the graphic alignment?
* Aura Widget:  Support for Infinite Duration (0=Expiration Time) auras, like "Storm, Earth, and Fire".
* Hub; Cast Bar: Changed the logic of Friendly Unit cast bars.  Perhaps this will help Capacitor Totem visibility?

6.15.2
---------------------------
* Unit Cache:
	- In LUA, When a table gets large, it will be slower to search. For some users, this cache may be quite large....
	- New features will automatically remove old data, and speed up lookups....
	- Added a second level Cache, which is looked at FIRST; not a saved variable (ie. erased on logout).  This should reduce frequent lookups to the BIG table.
	- Added a 'lastSeen' feature, where the function will timestamp when the unit was seen, and remove any unit entry (on login) not seen for 60 days.
* Combo Widget: Monks get to see their Chi displayed in the Combo widget


6.15.1
---------------------------
Fix for mouseover (and many other things)
* Fixed: Core: IsHighlighted...  figured out that IsShown() now returns a bool, rather than 1/0.  *sigh*

Fix for Friendly Class Colors
* Fixed:  Hub;Functions;GetFriendlyClass: IsInInstance() now returns true or false, rather than nil or false.  Updated the function to match WoW 6.0

---------------------------
* Curseforge Reupload

6.15.0
---------------------------
* TOC update to 60000
* WoD Update....
	* Fixed Target selection issue; UnitExists() now returns true/false, rather than 1/0
	* Fixed Mouseover issue; 6.0 no longer uses the Highlight region to indicate mouseover; Using Name text color change.
	* Fixed Elite/Dragon Texture being reshown; Using :SetAlpha(0) rather than nilling the texture.

6.13.4
---------------------------
* Core: Raised the default Dropdown Menu strata to TOOLTIP

---------------------------
* Core: Added XML Template, TidyPlatesDropdownDrawerTemplate
* Core: Dropdown Menu Replacement (Trying to fix Blocked Action/Protected UI Taint issues in Panels and Hub)

6.13.1

* Widgets: Fixed the Class Icon widget. Finally.  Added class-colored borders to each icon.
* Hub: Added a new checkbox to "Scale"; "Auto-Scale Mini Mobs", which will downscale those tiny guys, ironically making it easier to target.

* Hub: Moved "Health Bar" to the top of the Hub page

* Themes: More fixes for text issues.
* Themes: New Font: Started replacing "Accidental Presidency" with "Roboto Condensed" across the bundled themes.

* Quatre & Neon: Increased the text size by 1pt to reduce specific scaling concerns.


6.13.Beta2
---------------------------
* Removed the "Unit Spotlight" system, for the moment.  Don't worry- It will come back to the beta release!  I just need to get a solid release done to fix some issues.  Thanks for your patience :-)

* Added an option to "Spell Casting", "Enable Friendly Castbars"
* New Font: Started replacing "Accidental Presidency" with "Roboto Condensed" across the bundled themes.  Looks similar, but contains more complete character sets; Important for non-English languages.



6.12.6
---------------------------
- Widgets: Combo Point: Anticipation "fix"
- Hub: Cached class colors in instances

6.12.5
---------------------------
- Widgets: Unit Cache: Stores non-local units with a " (*)" suffix.
- Hub: Class colors on cached units shoud work properly

6.12.4
---------------------------
- Core: New unit data: unit.rawName, strips the (*) from nameplate names.
- Core: The carrier frame is now globally labeled with a unique frame name.
- Hub: Healer Tracking: Now uses unit.rawName rather than unit.name
- Widgets: Aura Tracker: Now uses unit.rawName to associate on-screen PvP names
- Widgets: Unit Cache: Will now properly filter non-realm units (ex. coalesced or battlegroup)

6.12.2/3
---------------------------
- Revert fix for viewport mod interaction.  Needs a bit more external testing, apparently.

6.12.1
---------------------------
- TOC Bump
- Core: OnShowCastbar will now check for unit health before proceeding, hopefully avoiding errors when the Castbar's OnShow handler is called early.
- * Fix for Viewport Mods (specifically, Sunn), particularly, when the actual vertical viewport is decreased.

6.12.0
---------------------------
- Core: Compatibility Mode: Restored alpha-override behavior
- Hub: Warning Glow: Fixed InCombatLockdown() reference

6.12.Beta4
---------------------------
- I may have fixed some bugs.  Or maybe that was a dream.  Hard to recall whilst under Benadryl's spell.
- Ok, I definitely changed some things, and I'm not getting errors in game.  That's a good sign.
- Made some changes to (hopefully) fix 1) debuff tracking oddities, and 2) lua error using health text.

6.12.Beta3
---------------------------
- Added a workaround/fix to the broken Blizzard function, InterfaceOptionsFrame_OpenToCategory.  Slash command shortcuts for /hub and /tidyplates will now work properly.
- Added a Compatibility Mode checkbox to the interface panel.  This will fall back to older anchoring methods.
- Core: The OnShow handler will skip all data gather on that first cycle; The Alpha data is (still) unreliable, causing GUID association issues.

6.12.Beta2
---------------------------
- Updated 6.12 with the changes made to the castbar during 6.11.  (Since 6.12 inherits the 6.10 core, it didn't see the progression)
- Aura Widget: Fixed issue where aura is briefly shown, then hidden.  Should be fixed.
- Added a copy of the reference to healthbar and castbar. for Threat Plates Compatibility.

6.12.Beta1
---------------------------
- Reintegration of 6.10 Core, which includes reorganization and rebuilding of the main engine.

6.11.3
---------------------------
- Check unit.health on spell cast functions, to catch premature update calls.

6.11.2
---------------------------
- In reverting, I missed updating the TOC version for TidyPlatesHub.  Updated for 50300

6.11.1
---------------------------
- Core: Fixed a cast bar bug, where the sub-object references were not being updated.  Addresses certain "attempt to perform arithmetic on field 'health' (a nil value)" errors

6.11
---------------------------
- Basically, I've given up trying to quickly patch up 6.10.  I've reverted to 6.9.9, and made the changes necessary for it to work with WoW 5.3.  If you want the Performance Mode stuff, grab the old version, or keep an eye out for it to be Re-Beta'd as 6.12.

These are the changes that I've migrated:
- Spell Casting Update, for WoW 5.3
- Core: Set initial fonts during Init/Hooking.  Removes the possibility of :SetFont() errors.
- Combo Points: "Antic ipation" fix for non-english regions


6.10.4
---------------------------
- Core: Fixed a major typo. Should fix SetStyle/Headline Mode and ClassIcon LUA errors at the very least.  Might explain some of the other elusive bugs.

6.10.3
---------------------------
* Performance Mode:
By default this is NOT enabled, reverting to the older, slower, reliable method.
Using Performance Mode may break HHTD and other nameplate addons.
You may also experience 'hung' nameplates.  Please report these, and try to be as
specific as possible in describing the condition of the game when it occured.

- Core: (Since 6.10.2) Performance Mode:  This enables the performance improvements introduced in 6.10.
- Core: Reintegrated original Alpha locking
- Core: More reorganization, pruning of old, dead methods
- Core: Set initial fonts during Init/Hooking.  Removes the possibility of :SetFont() errors.  Not sure why I didn't do this years ago.
- Panel: Removal of latent "Show Minimap Icon" button code

6.10.2
---------------------------
- Panel: New Option: Performance Mode.  This enables the performance improvements introduced in 6.10.  By default this is NOT enabled.
- Using "Performance Mode" may cause problems with other nameplate addons.

6.10.1
---------------------------
- Panel: Reverted the dropdown menu init changes from beta4.  Seems to be messing up the panel.
- Core: Blizz Spell Shadow: More thoroughly hidden
- Hub: Threat/Warning Glow fix
- Core: Spelltext; "Font Not Set" error - Hopefully fixed


6.10
---------------------------
Beta 6:
- Reorganized event handling structure to rigorously check the visibility of the parent nameplate to prevent showing previously hidden nameplates or hiding previously shown nameplates

Beta5
- Combo Points: "Anticipation" fix for non-english regions?  need to test
- Core: Back to hooking the base plate.
- Healertrack: Strsplit fix  (thought I fixed that several months ago.. hmmm...)

Beta4
- Refactored a bit of the Core
- Panel: Dropdown menu will now init when the interface panel is shown, rather than on load
- other stuff.  too tired to remember.



- Reparent Tidy Plates Frames to UIParent, Reanchor back to base nameplate = Performance boost.  Sweet.

6.9.9
---------------------------
- Hub: Added "Selective Optional Text"
- Deprecated: 'customart' Texture and theme functions.  Please use the Widget system to create additional textures. (Removing unused textures provides a small performance improvement)
- Core: Reorganized the nameplate strata, removing an unnecessary anchor frame
- Core: Reorganized and relabeled some internal functions, adding a few extra comments
- Core & Aura Widget: Made some changes to reduce extraneous calls.
- Aura Widget: "Show Dispellable Auras" should work, now.  Ran some BGs, and things seemed to work.
- Hub: Added a warning, notifying the user when they're not using a Hub-compatible theme.
- Hub: Added a divider line between Headings
- Aura Widget: The old method of applying the aura widget has been re-added; The new method (described somewhere below) is still preferred!
- Hub: Added "Enable External Widgets" checkbox, to control the running of the Global widget functions described in 6.9.6  *

6.9.8
---------------------------
- Hub: "By Threat" Color Modes will pass through enemy class colors, when available, and then use Reaction colors.  (NPC-Pets will continue to use the "By Threat" colors)
- Hub: "By Threat" Warning Glow Mode now incorporates "By Enemy Healer", so it can be used for Pvp without changing config.
* These changes may evolve into more situationally reactive configs... we'll see!
- Widgets: HealerTrack: Should more reliably and quickly detect the spec of the enemy units.

6.9.7
---------------------------
- Fixed Tank Aura Watcher issue

6.9.6
---------------------------
- Performance improvement on Hidden mobs
- Aura Widget: Better association of Player characters, especially for friendly Buffs
- More extensive 'nil' strsplit error checking
- Hub: Added "Reaction" and "Spell Casting" color options
- Hub: Added reaction colors to 'By Threat' Functions
- Hub: The Widget creation and update functions will look for, and call: TidyPlatesGlobal_OnInitialize, TidyPlatesGlobal_OnContextUpdate, TidyPlatesGlobal_OnUpdate.
	TidyPlatesGlobal_OnInitialize() is called when a nameplate is created or re-shown
	TidyPlatesGlobal_OnContextUpdate() is called when a unit is targeted or moused-over.  (Any time the unitid or GUID changes)
	TidyPlatesGlobal_OnUpdate() is called when other data about the unit changes, or is requested by an external controller.
	* These functions can be used to create and maintain non-theme widgets.  Eventually, they may be implemented directly into the Core
	* Widget authors should hook the existing function, if it's present (No Returns):
	  Ex.	local OriginalFunction = TidyPlatesGlobal_OnInitialize
		TidyPlatesGlobal_OnInitialize = function (extended)
			if not extended.widgets.mywidget then extended.widgets.mywidget = CreateFrame("Frame", nil, extended) end
			if OriginalFunction then OriginalFunction(extended) end
		end

6.9.5
---------------------------
- Core: Reversion of scale and alpha handling to 6.9.Beta3 (Removal of transition effects)

6.9.4
---------------------------
- I need coffee.  Now.

6.9.3
---------------------------
- Tapped Mobs now apparently have the color: 0.53, 053, 0.53.... so I've updated the core to properly ID tapped mobs
- Mousing over a nameplate will temporarily bring that frame to FrameLevel 1, which should help targeting in crowds.
- A few other little things that I can't recall now.  I need sleep!

6.9.2
---------------------------
- More bug fixing, which seems to be a blessing in disguise, since it's yeilding some removal of redundancies, and (hopefully) incremental improvement in performance.
- Hub: Added a new Filter Item, "Filter Mini-Mobs".  This'll allow you to scale and fade those pesky mobs with mini-nameplates.  70% works well for me.

6.9.1
---------------------------
- Fixed: Raid Icon Bug?  (Changed some stuff around to even further reduce the chance of an out-of-order plate styling.)
- Increased default rate of Alpha/Scale Transitions.  Can be changed via, TidyPlates:EnableFadeIn(FadeRate)
- Added some additional code to check for nil values in the Default Filter Function.
- Added Players to the "Filter" Hub Mode

Note: Threat Plates v6.008 is not completely compatible.  Please use Tidy Plates v6.8.3

6.9
---------------------------
- Core: Added Scale Transitions.  Disable via, TidyPlates:DisableFadeIn() or /tidyplates panel
- Core: Added full Alpha Transitions. Disable via, TidyPlates:DisableFadeIn() or /tidyplates panel
- Core: Added a Tidy Plates Panel checkbox to control the Scale/Alpha fade feature
- Core: New unit variable: unit.platetype = 1 or 2, where 1 = normal Blizzard nameplate, and 2 = mini nameplates (seen on 'drone' mobs, for example)
- Core: Added code to correct value '0' scale from delegate functions
- Core: The SetHealthbarColor delegate will now control the statusbar-backdrop color in addition to the healthbar color:
	- 1. The SetHealthbarColor delegate gradient has been deprecated (It accepted two rgb sets - r1,g1,b1,r2,g2,b2 - which corresponded to the endpoints of a gradient)
	- 2. SetHeatlhbarColor now accepts two rgba sets - r1, g1, b1, a1, r2, g2, b2, a2 - which define the healthbar color+alpha and the backdrop color+alpha, respectively.
- Core: Deprecated "SetStatusbarWidthMatching" flag
- Core: Deprecated "style.frame" - Blizz made some changes, rendering this option obsolete.
- Aura Widget: Added a check for destination name in the Aura Widget  (Fixes "AuraWidget.lua:658" error)
- Aura Widget: Fixed Default Prefilter Errors
- Aura Widget: 'TidyPlatesWidgets.SetAuraPrefilter(function) replaces 'TidyPlatesWidgets.SetDebuffPrefilter'
- Aura Widget: 'TidyPlatesWidgets.SetAuraFilter(function)' replaces the previous method of assigning the Filter into each Widget instance via 'wiget.Filter'
- Aura Widget: Filter function now accepts these return values:  [show, priority, r, g, b], where 'show' indicates that the aura should be displayed, 'priority' indicates
	how important the debuff is to display, and 'r',  'g', and 'b' indicate the vertex color of the border highlight.  This can be used to colorize auras for different
	schools or types.
- Aura Widget: Square/Small Auras will now terminate/expire properly, and call for a delegate update.
- Hub/Aura Widget: Added "Track Dispellable Debuffs on Friendly Units", which will allow you to track and highlight debuffs on friendly units that need to be dispelled.
	"Magic", "Poison", "Curse", or "Disease".  Have I tested it?  Hahahaha..he.. um, no.
- Hub/Aura Widget: Removed prefix, "No"; Useless in the current evolution of the Hub Filter system.
- Hub/Aura Widget: "CC" prefix will highlight the aura with a Yellow border
- Hub: Added Health/Optional Text Mode: By Arena ID. I have no clue if it works.
- Hub: Aura prefilter should work properly, instead of letting everything through
- Hub: Multi-Mode Functions will cross-check the table index, preventing out-of-range values from throwing errors.
- Hub: Removed/Replaced distinct "By Low Threat", "By High Threat", and similar Modes from Scale, Alpha, Name, and Color Spotlight functions.  THESE HAVE BEEN REPLACED by
	a single setting under the "Threat" Category, allowing you to control the Threat Mode for all Threat functions.
- Raid Tank/Target Watcher: Fixed Tanks.lua nil 'for' limit
- Raid Tank/Target Watcher: Fixed unitid/raidid issue.
- Raid Tank/Target Watcher: Added combat-log detection of melee attacks against non-tanks. (Untested)
- GroupCache: Fixed an issue where class color was not available for the last friendly raid member to join a team.  (Note: The GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE event is sometimes called
	before all the player data is available, leaving holes in the data table)

6.8.3
---------------------------
- Rogue Anticipation stacks are now displayed on the combo point widget
- AuraWidget.lua: Added some (currently inactive) code within aurawidget.lua for, "Personal Aura Tracker".  Feel free to mess with it.  Search for, "Personal Aura Tracker"
- AuraWidget.lua: Added some (currently inactive) code for highlighting abilities that can be activated.  Again, if you want to mess with it on your own, feel free.
- Made some changes to the Off-Tank Color feature; Enabling it will force detection of Off-Tanks, even if you are not a tank.  NOTE: There are still limitations inherent in the WoW-API which limits the ability of this feature to track all on-screen targets and target-ofs.

6.8.2
---------------------------
- TAPPED mobs now are a unit.reaction member
- Added "Filtered Unit Scale" to the Hub:Filter category
- Removed test code, which was accidentally causing Mages to get Priest coloring and Icon
- Support for Phanx's "Class Colors" addon, http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12513-ClassColors.html


6.8.1
---------------------------
- "Tapped" units (colored light purple by the Blizz nameplate system) will now register as "Hostile NPCs" in Tidy Plates.  This is partially inaccurate, since the tapped mobs could be neutral (like target dummies), but there is no way to discriminate this from the plate.
- Fixed several tainted global variables
- Added custom Monk and Priest color lookups for class recognition.  (RAID_CLASS_COLORS is not completely accurate)
- Changed the way the class colors are stored, hopefully fixing some other class ID problems
- Disable Tanks module by default.  Add option button to hub.
- Hopefully Fixed Off-Tank coloring issue.

6.8
---------------------------
- Updated to 5.1 ToC and new nameplate object configuration:

Nameplate Stack WoW 5.1:

Nameplate_Frame
	NameplateChild_Frame1_Statusbars
		Statusbars_Child_Frame1_Healthbar				(Statusbar)
		Statusbars_Child_Frame2_Castbar					(Statusbar)
		Statusbars_Region_Texture1_Threat				(Texture)
		Statusbars_Region_Texture2_HealthBarBorder		(Texture)
		...
		...
	NameplateChild_Frame1_UnitName
		UnitName_Region_Fontstring1_Name				(Fontstring)


6.7.9
---------------------------
- Corrected another error in the spell cast watcher; "StopCastAnimationOnNameplate" is now properly referenced.  This only affects arena matches.  I don't do arenas, so this was never properly tested.  Let me know if more errors pop up.

6.7.8
---------------------------
- Corrected a typo in the spell cast watcher; "StartCastAnimation" is now properly, "StartCastAnimationOnNameplate".  Arena fans rejoice!

6.7.7
---------------------------
- Fixed: Monk Tank mode (Stance of the Sturdy Ox stance added to the shapeshift list)
- Corrected various threat values coming into the threat line widget
- Core: extended plate verification process
- Removed many unneeded local variables
- Combed files for any "_" that could be global

6.7.6
---------------------------
- Added code to verify healthmax values.
- Sets framelevel to 0.  Targetted plates are raised to 1, which still does obscure the chatbox and minimap.  This also occurs with the standard Blizz nameplates, and cannot be corrected without raising the strata or level of those other frames.
- Added a rudimentary localization framework.  To use: Create an addon named, "TidyPlatesHubXX" where the XX is the last two letters of the localization code.  Ex. "TidyPlatesHubDE".  Within the code for that addon, create a table called, 'TidyPlatesHubLocalization', and add the translations.  For example:
TidyPlatesHubLocalization["Style"] = "Translation of STYLE".   See TidyPlatesHub\Lists.lua for an example.  Future versions will add a "Dump" mode for outputting all the text that needs translating.
- Changed the background, anchoring, and font sizes in the Hub, for readability.
- Changed the core template, and added a 'default' style, which looks like the Blizzard nameplates.  (will be useful in a future version)


6.7.5
---------------------------
- Removed framestrata code from, MinimapCluster, PlayerFrame, and TargetFrame
- Threat Line Widget:  Shootin' from the hip, again.

6.7.4
---------------------------
- Fixed giant threat bar issue (Corrected group size ranges in GetRelativeThreat() utility function)
- Raised MinimapCluster, PlayerFrame, and TargetFrame to "LOW" framestrata to prevent nameplates from obscuring those UI elements.
- Currently, there is no way to fix the brief 'flash' of the Blizzard nameplate art before it becomes active; It's a bug for the Blizz folks to solve.

6.7.3
---------------------------
- Removed debug code from GroupCache.lua (Chat log spam)


6.7.2
---------------------------
- Aura Widget: Fixed error, where certain auras filtered by spellid were not being displayed.
- Group Cache: Fixed updates for friendly group class colors (hopefully!)
- Group & Unit Cache: Will not try to search the global unit cache for class information while you are in a dungeon (could slow things down, and it isn't needed)
- Core: Reverted to earlier method of discriminating nameplates
- Threat Line Widget: Added some code to prevent it from accidentally becoming REALLY long.

6.7.1
---------------------------
- Fixed Range Widget bug

6.7
---------------------------
Beta9:
	- Upgraded the TOC file version number to 50001
	- Added: TidyPlates:EnableFadeIn() and TidyPlates:DisableFadeIn() functions, to control the nameplate fade-in mechanic.  Default is Enabled.

Beta8:
	- Removed debug console output

Beta7: r506
	- Added "Stance of the Sturdy Ox" to the Tank Aura list.  This should fix some "By Threat" oddities.
	- Added Monk specs to the HealerTrack widget.
	- Added PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD to Tank watcher events (to fix the line 39: nil errors)
	- (hopefully) fixed pauses while using the Arena mode with the Spell Cast Warning system

	- Jinx:
		- Right now, it looks like the debuff is applied by the server, not Your Character.  This is important because Tidy Plates ignores debuffs without a source.  In the beta, this debuff is properly displayed.

Beta6:
	- Capacitor Totem

Beta5:
	- Fixed: Bug where current theme selection would be lost when logging-in.

Beta4:
	- Added BUFFS to the aura widget.
	- Added texture coordinate function to tidyplates statusbar widget.  Usage/Example: healthbar.left = 0, healthbar.right = 1, healthbar.bottom = 0, healthbar.top = 1

Beta3:
	- The most visible change in Beta3 is the rearrangement of the Hub panel.  The debuff widget has been moved to its own category.
	- I've been working on a new way to control the health bar style.  I'm not sure when/if this code will become active.  I will probably post it as an alpha version after 6.7 is released.


Beta2:
What have I done so far?
	- Enhanced both the debuff widget and the spell cast warning module with support for Arena unitid event capture (via the standard event system, rather than the combat log).
	- Updated to MoP standards (which will work with 4.3, too)
		- Functions which have been renamed for MoP have been replaced by an internal function (provided by Tidy Plates) which is aware of the current client version, and will choose the appropriate function.
		- Tidy Plates now uses an internal button template, which replaces the UIPanelButtonTemplate2, which was removed in MoP



Testing
	- Need to test the Arena-Mode enhancements for the Debuff widget and Cast Warning system



Beta1 (r485)
	- Will do this later, too tired


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tidy Plates 6.6

6.6.2 (r465)
	- Fixed UnitCache Toolip 'nil' error

6.6.1 (r464)
	- Modified Unit Description Caching to work properly with addons that change the color of the tooltip text. (Like elvUI)
	- The Hub checks to see if the user has enabled any of the Aggro or 'By Threat' features, and automatically enables Blizz's Threat Warning feature. (which is required)

6.6.0
	- Under the "Style" category, all references to "Text-Only Plates" or "TextPlates" have been changed to "Headline Mode".  This change is intended to distinguish the style modifier from other references to "Text".  I'm sure some of you will hate this (can you come up with something better?), but I'm hoping that less cranky folks find the new grammar to be more intuitive.
	- To support the "Headline Mode" name change, I've added a new category.  Can you guess?  It's, "Headline".
	- I've grouped the "Color" and "Text" categories into "Color & Text", and moved them to the second-category position.  Why??  1: "Color & Text" controls the appearance of the default 'Health Bar' style.  2: Underneath, "Headline" controls the appearance of the 'No Bar' style.  Thus: This arrangement puts these options close to where the user selects the modes, in the "Style" category.
	- Square Debuff Icon Option: Added a new Debuff Widget option, "Debuff Style", which allows the user to select between the traditional "Wide" debuff format, or a more squareish "Compact" style.  The column count is increased to 5 for the "Compact" style.
	- Bookmark System: Added a "Bookmark" system to the Hub panels, which allows a user to jump directly to any of the categories
	- On certain themes, the position of your debuffs will be adjusted to allow the combo point widget to comfortably fit (on Rogues and Druids, only).  When the combo widget is disabled, the icons will "snug" themselves closer to the plate.
	- Using the '/hub' command will bring you to the Hub Configuration panel for your current theme
	- Added click sounds to the 'Copy' and 'Paste' buttons
	- Bug fixes and Memory optimization
	- Added a Prefilter option for the debuff widget cache
		* The hub enables the prefilter, when you're using the 'By Prefix" mode
		* Debuffs NOT on your list are not cached
		* This should save a ton of memory if you're using 'By Prefix'
	- Made some changes to the Unit Data Cache system to reduce memory use, and avoid certain 'lag' events...
		* Pet/Companion NPC titles are no longer cached
		* Cached unit guild and npc titles are now stored within the TidyPlatesWidgetData variable, keeping this data out of the base TidyPlates saved variables
		* Hub/Reset button will now clear the cached unit descriptions/titles and guilds
		* Unit descriptions (player guild name, or NPC role/title) will not be displayed while in an instance.  This is to avoid the CPU overhead that occurs when searching the database, which could be THOUSANDS of entries.  This is a direct cause for massive FPS drop, in some cases.
		* A side-effect of these changes is the clearing of user's stored guild names and NPC titles.  This is required to get the desired performance benefits.
	- Matched widget duration timer to default blizz interface standard (using 'floor' rather than 'ceil')
	- Fixed SpellId variable name in widgets\tank.lua
	- Spell Cast Monitor: If cast time is not greater than 0, make it a minimum of 1.5s
	- Added NameColorByEnemyClass
	- Minimize Hub now scale to 85%
	- Rearranged Name Color: By Friendly/Enemy class
	- Improved HealerTrack.lua, with help from Curseforge user, dakunesu.  Improves detection of healers in battlegrounds! Rockin!
	- Added a "Minimize" button to the /hub UI panel.  Clicking this will detach the Hub panel from the Interface Options window, and make it smaller.  Good for configuring stuff while playing.
	- The Copy & Paste buttons for the Hub panels now work with a unified Clipboard, so you can Copy & Paste between Tank and DPS panels.  Holding down "Shift" while clicking Copy or Paste will use the original Tank/DPS-specific caches.
	- New Hub Option: "Bring Casting Units to Spotlight Scale"
	- Unit Cache should filter out reputation names.  This fixes an issue occuring when "Colorblind" mode is active, causing Reputation to be displayed instead of an NPC's Title.
	- "Filter > Filter Inactive": When a unit is marked with a target/raid-icon, it's now assumed to be Active.
	- And more (ie. stuff I've forgotten about)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tidy Plates 6.5

(r433)
	* The "By Class" function of Health Bar Color has been changed to, "By Enemy Class".

	* Hub: Moved the two Text-Plate config options from 'Color' and 'Text', to 'Style'
	* Changed 'Frame' category to 'Advanced'
	* Added an option under 'Advanced'; "Enable Unit-Data Caching".  (Disabling this will stop non-party/pvp class-coloring)
	* Added a filter to the Unit-Data cache, to skip characters from other other realms
	* Unit-Data caching is bypassed while in an instance (Both PvP and PvE)
	* The caching system will peek at /who requests, and store the info on the Unit-Data table (Unless it's disabled)
	* Changed Neon's font to Accidental Presidency (Why?  Because I like it!)

(r406)
	* When "Show Party Aggro" (under Threat) is enabled, the "By Threat" spotlight systems for Opacity and Scale will now highlight your unfortunate party members.
	* The Health and Text colors mode, "By Threat" has been changed to, "By Threat (Auto-Detect).  The previous implementation has been renamed to "By Threat (Legacy)"
		* When using a tank stance, aura, or form, you'll see the "Safe" color when you have aggro, and the "Warning" color when you don't.  When NOT in a tank mode, you'll see the "Warning" color when you have aggro.

	+ These modifications will allow faster implementation of certain features, and will lead to a more extensive and useable configuration system
	+ Reset of Hub Settings (necessary, due to the relocation of saved variables)
	+ Added "By Health" and "By Low Health" modes to Scale, Colors, and Opacity.
	+ Added Low/High Health Threshold sliders, and color selection for Low/Mid/High Health
	+ Reorganized the Hub panel (in particular, the Opacity filter section is now under its own heading)

		! Not quite finished

-----------------
6.4...

(r363)
- Fixed: Re-Added unit.spellIsShielded to cast color delegate
- Added: MaximumDisplayableDebuffs variable under Debuff Widget.  This will allow user-configurable debuff quantities.

(r358)
- Added: Tip text next to Hub Debuff widget config
- Fixed: Friendly Group unit class coloring
- Re-removed: Minimap button.  The code is still there, but hidden.  If you liked the button, use this command:   /run TidyPlatesOptions._EnableMiniButton = true; ReloadUI()

(r355)
- Fixed: List-to-lookup table conversion for Unit Filter, By Name
- Fixed: Hub/Tank slider ranges (They were not actually broken, just different from the Damage Hub)

(r350)
- Fixed: Incorrect Paths in TidyPlatesWidgets (causing several widgets to not work)
- Fixed: Hub Tank Panel, SplitToTable error

(r348)
- More messing around with debuff widget
- Cleaned up some of Neon's artwork
- Changed default Neon font to Headache
- Debuff & Buff display for Friendly units is internally complete, but is disabled until the Hub can be updated
- Debuff widget now provides .unit table from the underlying nameplate, to allow better filtering.

(r344)
- No clue

(r340)
- Fix for Debuff Widget empty table/sort error
- Corrected a mistyped line for indexing Aura_Dispell type

(r338)
- Debuff Priority works for "Show Specific" and "Show My Specific" modes, in addition to "By Prefix"
- Class Icon Widget: Returned to using internal artwork
- All textures are now Non-blocking (the game won't wait for textures to load into memory before it draws the scene), preventing texture changes from affecting frame rate
- The debuff widget (should now be called Aura Widget) will track buffs for friendly players

(r308)
- Debuff widget now uses single dimension tables to store cached data, to improve memory management
- Moved Widgets to their own addon/folder (For memory usage tracking)
- Statusbar gradients are now supported via additional return values in theme.SetHealthbarColor()...
	* return r1, g1, b1, [r2, g2, b2]
- The Debuff widget now supports 'priority' through the existing .filter function... example:
	* return showThisAura, auraPriority
- The Hub Panels will check the order of the debuffs in its list to determine priority.
- Class Widget no longer uses internal class artwork; Instead, the class icon is pulled from the Blizz UI library.
- If theme.SetCastbarColor returns nil, the cast animation will be skipped
	* This can be used to filter spell casting data
	* SetCastbarColor is passed the 'unit info' table, which contains: unit.isCasting, unit.spellName, unit.spellID, unit.spellInterruptible

6.3
-----------------

6.3.8 (r307)
* Removed: Toggle for Minimap button.  The minimap buttons does't work completely as-intended, so I've removing it for general release, sooner rather than later.

6.3.7 (r304)
* Fixed: LDB Icon Registration
* Modified: Minimap Icon Position
	- Note: The icon does not save a user-placed position, yet.

6.3.6 (r301)
* Fixed: UnitCache Error
* Fixed: Graphite Loading Error
* Added: Spell Cast Monitor will not look for casts from current target
* Added: Hub Option, Scale: Ignore Inactive/Undamaged Mobs

6.3.5 (r295)
- Self-Test for DebuffWidget.lua added, in order to inform users of possible issues.  (I hope to address auto-updater bug)
- Cleaned up some code to reduce "double calls" to delegate and update functions

6.3.4 (r293)
- More Debuff Widget fixes
- Improved Debuff Widget memory usage

6.3.3 (r292)
- Debuff widget should gracefully handle certain aura events.  (GetSpellInfo errors)


6.3.2 (r291)
- Tidy Plates Hub: Debuff Widget: Spell IDs can now be used instead of spell names in the filter system.
- Fixed: Crazy debuffs during Firelands dailies.
- Aurainstance table (for debuff widget) and functions have been converted to a smarter format
- When auras are updated on your current target, the caching function will clear the cache before it repopulates the list.
- Increased the scope of name/elite status updates.  Hopefully this will accommodate the Firelands Smoldering/Blazing Elemental Bug.

6.3.1 (r289)
- Fixed debuff update stalling
- Added nil value error protection to debuff prefix sorter

6.3.0 (r284) 55,754
	* Updated functions for 4.2
	* Increased width of sliders in Hub
	* Opacity functions now use a transfer function to correct the opacity (currently, .5 does not translate to 50% opaque; it's more like 65%)
	* Channeled spells now move the cast bar in reverse.
	* Friendly/Enemy "V-key" Automation; In Combat, Out of Combat, Always
	* Debuff widget now Caches texture of debuffs (to fix sunfire phenomenon, and similar)

6.2 (r269)
-----------------
* The Hub gets a new category: Style
	- This new category has two menus for Friendly and Enemy nameplates
	- Users can select between two styles (Health Bars vs Text Only), and several different visibility conditions.
	- If you use the Text Only bars, you might want to check out the Name Text Color options, to spice up that text!
* Spell Cast Monitor name search will now strip the "-" from the combat log name, which should fix PvP cast association issues.
* Debuff Widget will now strip the "-" from combat log events, which should fix pvp association issues
* fixed a 'nil' error during pet/tank association
* "Avoid Overlap" has been updated for the new CVar types
* Fixed a bug where the debuff widget was not getting the correct data from the combat log

6.1
-------------

6.1.13
	- tweaked name color function

6.1.12
	- Fixed Hub/Tank NameTextColor errors
	- Updated description of "Vertical Position of Frame" to "Vertical Position of Artwork"

6.1.11
	NEW! Keyword filtering for the Debuff Widget
	- See Demo on Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KjGFd0TgvM
	- By Prefix.. Mode for Debuff Widget
		- ALL, MY, NO, OTHER, CC
		- Using CC will eventually highlight the debuff on the widget, but for now it just acts as "ALL"

	- Fixed UnitChannelInfo interruptable spell argument bug
	- Found a bug; The Editboxes contained in my ScrollFrames seem to invisibly extend past the bottom of the scrollframe, which can block underlying UI controls.  I've dropped the editboxes to a lower frame level, which is a hack method of preventing problems with it interferring with controls anchored to the bottom of the scrollframe.  Will attempt to figure out a better solution.
	- Name text coloring modes
	- By Raid Icon modes for Opacity and Scale

6.1.8 (r227)
	- PTR bug fixes (Neon Threat Glow was turning green)
	- Debuff widget will clear aurainstance tables when combat ends (regen returns)
	- Added Health Text option: Approximate Health (will show 2 decimal places for thousands (k) and millions (M), with suffix)
	- Added Text option, "Use Default Blizzard Font"; This will use the font defined by the global variable, 'NAMEPLATE_FONT'.  This should improve the situation for non-latin charcter sets (this is for you, Chinese, Russians, Taiwanese, and Koreans.. xoxo)

	- At this stage of development, If you can't figure out how to enable it on your own, YOU SHOULDN'T.
- Changed the update functions a wee bit to try and reduce CPU load.  Some plates may not be updating correctly.  Complain wisely (ie. with specifics) and it shall be fixed.

- fixed nil values during set scale
